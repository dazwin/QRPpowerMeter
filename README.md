
## Summary

A QRP dummy load and RF power meter


## Description

The code for this project is written for an Arduino Nano, and it also requires a custom circuit board which contains the dummy load resistors and other circuits required for RF power measurement.

The code uses the SSD1306Ascii OLED display library (version 1.3.0) which can be found here:
